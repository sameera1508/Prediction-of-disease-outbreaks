# Prediction-of-disease-outbreaks
# ðŸ“– Overview

This project focuses on predicting disease outbreaks and individual health conditions including Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Diabetes using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Built using Python and deployed with Streamlit, the application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with predictive models, making healthcare predictions accessible and easy to understand.

# ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Disease Outbreak Prediction based on historical and environmental dataâœ… Individual Health Predictions for:

Heart Disease

Parkinsonâ€™s Disease

Diabetesâœ… Interactive web interface powered by Streamlitâœ… Real-time prediction results with user-friendly input formsâœ… Visualization of model outputs and key metrics

# ðŸ“¢ Future Enhancements

Add more disease prediction models

Integrate real-time data for outbreak predictions

Improve model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning

Enhance UI/UX with additional visualization features
